Quantum Advantage

Scientists and engineers at Xanadu Quantum Technologies built a quantum computer called Borealis which is capable of achieving quantum advantage.

Fortunately now anyone can use this quantum computer over the internet.
This is the first time that such a powerful quantum computer has been made available to the public.

In this video I'm showing that how you can get access to this powerful quantum computer.
